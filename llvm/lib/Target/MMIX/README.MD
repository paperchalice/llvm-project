# LLVM MMIX backend

## Introduction
> MMIX is a computer intended to illustrate machine-level aspects of programming. In my books The Art of Computer Programming,
  it replaces MIX, the 1960s-style machine that formerly played such a role...
  I strove to design MMIX so that its machine language would be simple, elegant, and easy to learn.
  At the same time I was careful to include all of the complexities needed to achieve high performance in practice,
  so that MMIX could in principle be built and even perhaps be competitive with some of the fastest general-purpose computers in the marketplace."
